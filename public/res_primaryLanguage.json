      "description": "My name is Terese Mihalcin. I have studied Computer Science at Seton Hill University for four years. I will earn my BS in Computer Science in May 2022. I am passionate about all things technology but I have a particular interest in Front-end Development. I have experience in ReactJS and Angular. I also have experience in Mobile development, particularly using Swift for IOS and Java for Android. I am confident in my ability to use version control systems such as GitHub as well as SourceTree. My goal as a young professional is to increase my knowledge in all software development areas, Specifically ReactJS and JavaScript. I also aim to broaden my understanding of other development processes such as database management and Back-end development. I feel that the tools I received as Seton Hill University gave me the ability to follow the path I am aiming for, but I am eager to continue my learning experience in a professional setting. Outside of my studies I have played Collegiate volleyball at Seton Hill for four years. Additionally, I enjoy many outdoor activities such as skiing, biking, and kayaking.",
